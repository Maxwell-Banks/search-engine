# search-engine
Takes .txt document names as inputs and then requests 
inputs from the user that it searches the documents for and 
returns a folder for the given terms and returns a list of the 
initially given documents in order of number of relevance. 


Issues:
  Needs to be improved to not totally break when a string not 
  contained in the list of the text files is given as an input
  
  Lots of imporvments to be made including way more optimization
